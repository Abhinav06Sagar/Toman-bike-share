In this project, I developed a Toman Bike Share Dashboard using Power BI to analyze key performance metrics of a bike-sharing service. This dashboard provides insights into hourly revenue analysis, profit and revenue trends, seasonal revenue variations, and rider demographics to support data-driven decision-making.

Data Analysis Workflow:

The analysis was conducted through the following steps:

1.Database Creation: Structured raw bike-share data into a relational database.

2.SQL Query Development: Wrote SQL queries to extract and transform relevant data.

3.Power BI Integration: Connected Power BI to the database for real-time data visualization.

4.Dashboard Development: Built interactive reports and visualizations in Power BI.

The project utilizes SQL for data extraction and transformation, Power BI for visualization, and a relational database such as MySQL for storage. By leveraging these technologies, this dashboard effectively transforms raw data into actionable insights, allowing businesses to optimize operations and improve decision-making strategies.
